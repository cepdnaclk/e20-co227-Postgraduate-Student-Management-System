This is the frontend application built with [Angular](https://angular.io/). It serves as a dynamic, single-page web application. Follow the steps below to set up, run, and explore the project.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js** (v14.x or later): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Angular CLI**: Install Angular CLI globally using npm:
     npm install -g @angular/cli


## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone [https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e20-co227-Postgraduate-Student-Management-System/tree/main/Angular%20Frontend).git

## Running the Application

Start the Angular development server:
ng serve

By default, Angular runs the application on port 4200. If it's already in use, a different port will be chosen (e.g., http://localhost:4201)
